# MachineLearning

Objective: Heart Disease dataset with objective of building binary classification model

Source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/

Requirements:
•	Anaconda
•	Python 3.0
•	Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda
•	Importing following Libraries:
              Pandas
              Numpy
              Matplotlib
              Scikit-learn

•	The above data processed for machine learning model is under supervised learning.
•	Used Classification algorithm as the output is restricted to only two values.                                   
## Modeling Overview

Review of predictive modeling:
 Statistical technique to predict unknown Outcomes

Data terminology 

Inputs-Independent variables (also known as features or Predictors)
Outputs- Dependent variable (outcome)

Model Explain the effect that features have on the outcome

Assessing model performance:
•	Randomly spilt observations into train/test sets 
Build model on train set and asses performance on test set

•	AUC of ROC is common performance metric
o	True positive vs. false positive rates	
	

Task:  Given the regular checkup report of patients and predict whether there is any Heart disease or not
